<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5><li>The observed behavior</li></h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <h5><li>Increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></h5>
  <p> The decrease and increase in energy is due to the fact that in </br> 
    some months more KHW is consumed than in others, resulting </br> 
    in a large variation between the months studied.  
  </p>     
  <h5><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></h5>
  <p> The first 2 months the energy consumption was close to the linear </br>
    regression, after month 3 they do not follow a defined behavior being </br>
    this a regression that is not reliable
  </p>
  <h5><li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li></h5>
  
  <p> 

  <h5><li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li></h5>  
  <p>To conclude, it can be noted that in the course of the last 5 months</br>
  between December and April the energy use has been adequate since the</br>
  consumption has not been so high, with the first 2 months close to the</br>
  regression line, while the last 3 months were more dispersed, thus being</br>
  an unreliable regression. To keep the consumption stable, it can be</br>
  regulated so that energy is not wasted and only use what is necessary</br>
  to keep it in average values without being so high and close to the regression line.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5><li>About the observed behavior</li></h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <h5><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></h5>
  <p>As for the graph between residents and energy consumption in KWH,</br>
  some had a significant increase in consuming more energy than others</br>
  with respect to the number of people living in the house except for one</br>
  case where there are many people (6) but with very little energy consumption (93 KWH).
  </p>
  <h5><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></h5>
  <p>In this case, the red dots refer to the amount of KWH </br>
  of the residents, while eight of them, in terms of consumption,</br>
  were close to the linear regression with a defined behavior, making</br>
  it reliable, the other two were extremely dispersed with no defined</br>
  behavior, making it an unreliable regression. 
  </p>
  <h5><li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li></h5>
  <h5><li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li></h5>
</ul>
