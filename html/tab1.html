<h3>Electric energy</h3>
<p>
  Is the energy generated by the movement <br />
  of electrons from one point to another and <br />
  the power an atom's charged particles have to cause <br />
  an action or move an object.

<h3>Watt (physical unit)</h3>
<p>
  Is the International System of Units (SI) standard unit of power <br />
  (energy per unit of time), equivalent to one joule per second. <br />
  Watts are used to indicate the rate at which electrical energy <br />
  is dissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated,<br />
  absorbed, or dissipated.

<h3>Scatter plot</h3>
<p>
  Is uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. <br />
  The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates <br/ >
  values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe<br />
  relationships between variables.

<h3>Linear regression</h3>
<p>
  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable <br />
  based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict<br />
  is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict <br />
  the other variable's value is called the independent variable. <br />

<h3>Renewable energy</h3>
<p>
  Is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a <br />
  higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example,<br />
  are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy<br />
  sources are plentiful and all around us.<br />
  Examples <br />

<h3>Solar energy</h3>
<p>
  Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and <br />
  can even be harnessed in cloudy weather. <br />
  The rate at which solar energy is intercepted by the Earth is about<br />
  10,000 times greater than the rate at which humankind consumes energy.

<h3>Wind energy</h3>
<p>
  Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by<br />
  using large wind turbines located on land (onshore) or in <br />
  sea- or freshwater (offshore). Wind energy has been used for <br />
  millennia, but onshore and offshore wind energy technologies<br />
  have evolved over the last few years to maximize the electricity<br />
  produced - with taller turbines and larger rotor diameters.

<h3>Bioenergy</h3>
<p>
  Bioenergy is one of many diverse resources available to help <br />
  meet our demand for energy. It is a form of renewable energy that <br />
  is derived from recently living organic materials known as biomass,<br />
  which can be used to produce transportation fuels, heat, electricity, <br />
  and products
