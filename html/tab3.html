<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5><li>About the observed behavior</li></h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <h5><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></h5>
  <p> 
      This increase and decrease can be evidence with the use of the energy in my house in </br>
      the different months between December and April
  </p>    

  <h5><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></h5>
  <p>The dots don’t have an order in the graphic. One of the red dots (in the second month)</br>
    is pretty close to the linear regression but is not on it, then in the fifth month have</br>
    the same behavior, for this reason this Linear Regression is not a good base for a study

  <h5><li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li></h5>
  <h5><li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li></h5>
  <p>
    My conclusion is that the KWH per month don increase more than 70KWH</br>
    and don’t decrease more than 62KWH is a regular in the first one,</br>
    second one and fourth month we didn’t spend a lot of time in the</br>
    hose in comparison of third one and fifth month, so the way to don’t</br>
    spend a lot of energy is don’t be a lot in the house or disconnecting</br>
    the home appliances while we are not at home
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5><li>About the observed behavior</li></h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <h5><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></h5>
  <p>
  The increasement in the majority of the cases is given for</br>
  the number of habitants of the house, an exceptional case is</br>
  the one that they consume 93KWH and they are 6 in the house
  </p>
  <h5><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></h5>
  <p>In this linear regression we can see that is most exactly</br>
  than the first one but making an study we can see that only</br>
  one red dot is on the grey dot for this reason is not exactly</br>
  at all and I can say this linear regression is still not be a</br>
  good base for this evidence
  </p>
  <h5><li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li></h5>
  <h5><li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li></h5>
</ul>
